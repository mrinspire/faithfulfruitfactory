Our History

We were founded in the early 1990's by a humble family from the Eastern part of Asia. our company was started by a family who had a passion for citrus fruit. Especially for rare fruit that very little people knew about. They decided to bring these rare fruits to parts of the world that really had not seen and/or tasted these fruits because they did not what anyone to miss out on what they had enjoyed from their youth. They also did not want to leave those delicious fruits behind so they brought them with them to North America. Now all can enjoy the best fruit the way they have their whole lives.
